## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Desktop**: Electron 33 + Node.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **Build**: electron-builder (NSIS installer for Windows)
- **Updates**: Manual via GitHub Releases

### How It Works
1. **Main Process**: Electron handles file operations, downloads, and game launching
2. **Renderer Process**: React UI communicates with main process via IPC
3. **Backend**: API calls to UnionCrax for game metadata and download links
4. **Updates**: Opens GitHub Releases for new versions
